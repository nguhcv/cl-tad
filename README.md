## How to train a model with SF_TAD:
1. Run **main/main_train.py**
2. Since we supported codes to train dataset, run one of them by seleting the dataset setting in main. Following image shows a example how to train ecg-dataset. (ts_num indicates ordinal number of the sub-dataset)

## How to test a model with SF_TAD:
1. Run **main/main_train.py**
2. Since we supported codes to train dataset, run one of them by seleting the dataset setting in main. Following image shows a example how to train ecg-dataset. (ts_num indicates ordinal number of the sub-dataset, saved_path indicates the directory that store the trained model). Our trained model is stored in **saved_modules**
